            <h2 class="code2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="code3">Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian cricketer and the captain of
                 India national cricket team in Test and ODI formats. Widely regarded as one of the best 
                 batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all time,[3] he 
                 is also regarded one of the greatest six hitters in cricket history. 
                 He is a right-handed batsman who plays for India in international cricket,
                  Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket. Rohit previously captained 
                  India in all three formats, and after leading the team to victory in 2024 T20 World Cup, 
                  he announced his retirement from T20Is.[4][5]</p>
            
       <p class="code3">He plays for Mumbai Indians and Mumbai cricket team in Indian Premier League (IPL) and domestic cricket respectively. He formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 Indian Premier League titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under him, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS Dhoni. With India, Rohit Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. He is also one of two players who have played in every edition of the T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2024.[b] He is the only Indian player to win two T20 World Cups. He became the second Indian captain to win a T20 World Cup, when he led India to win the 2024 T20 World Cup.

        He has received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government of India. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.</p>

         <h3 class="code2 ">Playing style</h3>  
        <p class="code3"> Sharma is an aggressive batsman but plays with style and elegance.[111][112] He is usually an opening batsman in limited overs cricket, but has played most of his Test cricket as a middle-order batsman.[113][114] In limited overs cricket, Sharma is widely recognised as one of the format's most outstanding batsmen.[115][116] And for his attacking batting and six hitting abilities he often referred as Hitman.[117]

            Sunil Gavaskar considers Sharma to have a batting style similar to those of Virender Sehwag and Viv Richards. In his column for The Times of India in November 2018, Gavaskar said:[118]
            
            The standout performer in both the limited overs series and the T20 series has been Rohit Sharma. Like Virender Sehwag before him, he is unstoppable once he gets going and like Viru he has an appetite for big hundreds. When Viru used to get out looking to hit another delivery out of the park, there used to be consternation around the ground, just like it is when Rohit gets out to a seemingly casual shot. If Rohit can turn his white ball exploits into red ball cricket, he will be the most destructive batsman in the world after Viv Richards and Virender Sehwag.
            
            While Sharma is not a regular bowler, he can bowl right-arm off spin.[11] He usually fields in the slips and has said this is a part of his game which he works very hard on for improvement.[119]
            
             </p> 
             <h3 class="code2">Achievements</h3>
             <p class="code3"> Sharma scored the highest-ever individual score in a One Day International match, with a 264 against Sri Lanka at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata on 13 November 2014.[11] He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs.[120] In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[121] In 2019, Sharma became the only batsman to scored five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.[122]

                On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman.[123] In the same series, he broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.[124]
                
                On 11 October 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan team, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international sixes (553).[125][126]
                
                On 14 October 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format.[127] This feat occurred during an India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 100,000 fans.[128]
                
                During a 22 October 2023 match against New Zealand, Sharma became the first Indian batter to hit 50 One Day International (ODI) sixes in a calendar year.[129]
                
                On 2 August 2024, Sharma surpassed Eoin Morgan to have hit most sixes in international cricket as captain.[130]
                
                Sharma's 19 Player of the Match awards is the highest in IPL history</p>
